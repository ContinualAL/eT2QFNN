# eT2QFNN
This is the code of evolving fuzzy neural network, namely evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eT2QFNN), 
which features an interval type-2 quantum fuzzy set with uncertain jump positions.
The quantum fuzzy set possesses a graded membership degree which enables better identification of overlaps between classes.
The eT2QFNN works fully in the online mode where all parameters including the number of rules are 
automatically adjusted and generated on the fly. The parameter adjustment scenario relies on decoupled extended Kalman filter method.
